    "\n",
    "This portion of the RAVDESS contains 1440 files: **60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The RAVDESS contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech emotions includes **calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust** expressions. Each expression is produced at **two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong)**, with an additional neutral expression.\n",

    "### File naming convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the 1440 files has a unique filename. The filename consists of a 7-part numerical identifier (e.g., 03-01-06-01-02-01-12.wav). These identifiers define the stimulus characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).\n",
    "- Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).\n",
    "- Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).\n",
    "- Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.\n",
    "- Statement (01 = \"Kids are talking by the door\", 02 = \"Dogs are sitting by the door\").\n",
    "- Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).\n",
    "- Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).\n",
